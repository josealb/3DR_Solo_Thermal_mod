# 3DR_Solo_Thermal_mod
Mod for the 3DR Solo to control a thermal camera with gimbal
This software moves a PWM channel depending on the angle of the GoPro gimbal. When calibrated, this makes a second gimbal move in sync with the original Solo gimbal.
Also, the Flir camera is triggered when the GoPro takes pictures or starts recording. (Flir video/photo mode has to be changed manually since it is not possible to change it via PWM)
Small demonstration video of the gimbal sync capability can be seen here
